Today's readings covered the history and SOC security compliance, beginning with SAS 70 reports conducted in the 90s. SOC 2 reports focus on audits violating a series of "
"Trust Principles", which include privacy, security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality. The reading notes
the many benefits of SOC 2 compliance, including an established trust with customers and partners, the improvement
of security, a better company culture, and documentation offering accountability in the event of a security breach. These are all 
important in providing a more organized and well functioning company.
